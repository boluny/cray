cray
====

A micro static blog generator

Motivation
----------

The lazy author forgot the `Jekyll <http://jekyllrb.com>`_ usage and don't want to install Ruby and all start from 
the beginning.
# Yeah I know it's a shabby project until now but it will be updated in times.

Usage 
-----

1. Clone the repository.

2. Cd into the root directory of the repository, install it using 
.. code-block:: bash 
    $ pip install .

3. .. code-block:: bash
    $ cray init [your-site-name]

    $ cd [your-site-name] && cray generate

    $ cray preview
4. Open browser for `http://127.0.0.1/ <http://127.0.0.1/>`_


Progress
--------

That's depends on some stuff if the author is defeated in **LOL** or **Wang Zhe Rong Yao** 
which is a game like LOL but on mobile platforms.

TODO list
---------

1. Usage hint of the program and CLI improvment.
2. Add more unit tests.
3. Refactor if target #1 is done.
4. Want to generate mindmap using d3.js if I could write a markdown to d3 tree converter.
